api endpoint project

As a DTP and procurement officer 
I want to extract BRS data from CRM by defining the breed group, activity and edition 
So I can use the data for the publishing the BRS 
Create entity for generating the the different breed group or activity reports for BRS
New entity should include:
Created date
Year 
Quarter 
breed group ||
activity 
User 
Attachment 
Status - successful, failed 
On saving of the record the end point to generate the report will be called 
No download of report. Report will be stored in new BRS Report entity as attachment
